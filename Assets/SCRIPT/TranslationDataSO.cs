    //How I want to use it: it is created empty here, but objects can create at editor time a new entry
    //They then get back a id number corresponding to their string id
    //They then ask the class by getting a entry from the dictionary
    //The class will then return the correct string depending on the language

    //But I'll work on that late

    //public Dictionary<>
